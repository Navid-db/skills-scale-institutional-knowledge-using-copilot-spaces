## Responsibility Matrix Reference

Use this matrix to understand who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) for key activities:

| Activity | Developer | Product Manager | Project Manager | UX Designer | Business Analyst | QA Lead | DevOps Engineer | Customer Success |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Requirements Definition** | C | A | I | C | R | C | I | C |
| **Design Creation** | C | C | I | R/A | I | C | I | I |
| **Implementation** | R/A | C | I | C | C | C | C | I |
| **Testing** | C | C | I | C | I | R/A | C | I |
| **Deployment** | C | I | C | I | I | C | R/A | I |
| **Risk Management** | C | C | R/A | I | I | C | C | I |
| **Stakeholder Communication** | I | C | R/A | I | C | I | I | C |
| **Release Decision** | I | R | A | I | I | C | C | I |
| **Customer Feedback** | I | A | I | C | C | I | I | R |
| **Retrospective Facilitation** | C | C | R/A | C | C | C | C | C |

**Legend:**
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (final decision maker)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (kept in the loop)
